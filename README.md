🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple and fun **Python console game** where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it!  
The program gives hints — whether your guess is **too high** or **too low** — until you get it right.

---

🚀 Features
- Random number generation using the `random` module  
- Hint messages for every guess  
- Tracks number of attempts  
- Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric entries)  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand  

---

🧠 How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. The program will choose a number between **1 and 100**.
3. Enter your guesses until you find the correct number.
4. The program will tell you:
   - 🔼 “Too high!” if your guess is greater than the number  
   - 🔽 “Too low!” if your guess is less than the number  
5. Once you guess correctly, it will show the total number of attempts.
