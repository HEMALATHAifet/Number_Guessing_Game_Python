# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple and fun **Python console game** where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it!  
The program gives hints — whether your guess is **too high** or **too low** — until you get it right.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Random number generation using the `random` module  
- Hint messages for every guess  
- Tracks number of attempts  
- Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric entries)  
- Beginner-friendly and easy to understand  

---

## 🧠 How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. The program will choose a number between **1 and 100**.
3. Enter your guesses until you find the correct number.
4. The program will tell you:
   - 🔼 “Too high!” if your guess is greater than the number  
   - 🔽 “Too low!” if your guess is less than the number  
5. Once you guess correctly, it will show the total number of attempts.

## 💻 Code Example

```python
import random

def number_guessing_game():
    print("🎯 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

    secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
    attempts = 0

    while True:
        try:
            guess = int(input("Enter your guess: "))
            attempts += 1

            if guess < secret_number:
                print("Too low! Try again 👇")
            elif guess > secret_number:
                print("Too high! Try again ☝️")
            else:
                print(f"🎉 Congratulations! You guessed it right in {attempts} attempts.")
                break

        except ValueError:
            print("⚠️ Please enter a valid number.")
